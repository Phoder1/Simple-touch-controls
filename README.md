Touch controls homework

Super simple touch control: Touch the star for drag and drop, outside for a virtual joystick.
As I didn't put enough effort to actually calculate the joystick real size in unity units, I suspect the speed will change depending on resolution, but I didn't actually checked it and for my purposes it works perfectly.

100% homemade.
